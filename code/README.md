# Computation harvesting in road traffic dynamics


## System requirements

a. The codes can be run with python 3.7.0 or else on any operating system.

b. We implemented the codes with python 3.7.0 on Mac.

c. No non-standard hardware is required.



## Installation guide

Before setting up the package, users should have Python version 3.7 or higher, and several packages set up from Python 3.7. The latest version of python can be downloaded from the official website: https://www.python.org/

```
pandas: 0.23.4
numpy: 1.15.1
matplotlib: 2.2.3
plotly: 4.9.0
```



## Instructions for use the python codes



Run CH algorithm (for drawing the figures in the paper) as follows at ~/code/src:


###Figure 3 (a):

python plot_heatmap.py


###Figure 3 (b) and Figure 5:

python run_prediction_day1.py


###Figure 3 (c):

python plot_heatmap_cross.py


###Figure 3 (d):

python run_prediction_day1_to_day2.py 


###Figreu 4(a)~(c):

python plot_attractor.py


###Figure 4 (d) is calculated with the files generated by the previos code.

ar.csv, recnstruct.csv, and target.csv

Compare the data by wasserstein distance, whose code is abilable at

wassersteinCC.zip that has been  downloaded from http://folk.ntnu.no/muskulus/menu/software/ (not abailale now).
